# ProcessingProject-DataVisualization
The primary goal of this project is to manipulate graphics objects/images using Processing. The Distance 2D example should be modified so that the size of the ellipses are toggled. Get Child example should be modified so that the 7 states' colors rotates through the rainbow colors.
